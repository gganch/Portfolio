        <h2>What is Colony Collapse Disorder</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a city without any adults, seemingly gone without a single trace. They haven't died,  they didn't move, they are just...gone.   Children are left roaming the streets, babies still in their cribs, while the mayor sits in his office wondering what the hell happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          This scenario is similar to how colony collapse disorder (CCD) affects bee colonies.   A colony suspected of CCD has no adult bees, and strangely enough, few or no dead bees in or around the hive.  The colony contains pollen and honey, a queen and capped brood.   Without adults, inefficient young workers are left to sustain the hive.  With a weak and depleted workforce the colony can't maintain itself and collapses.

        <h2>What Causes CCD?</h2>
        <p>
          While much research has been done on CCD, scientists have yet to determine the exact cause. Initially environmentalists were concerned that the increased usage of pesticides in farming was contributing to CCD.  Newer research indicates that stress could be causing colony collapse.  A more balanced theory is that stress and a combination of factors such as pesticides, mites, disease, and changes in beekeeping practice cause CCD.

        <p>
          Educating yourself is the first step.  You can also donate to our ongoing research to determine the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder.  We also donate a portion of funds to ethical beekeeping.  Volunteers are always welcome, view our About page for a list of chapters to find the location nearest you.  If you are interested in learning more about beekeeping, you can <a href="#">request a complimentary copy</a> of One for the Honey: A Beginner's Guide to Bees and Beekeeping.
