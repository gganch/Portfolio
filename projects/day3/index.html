          <p class="description"><em>Favorite Quotes</em></br>“Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.”–Winston Churchill</br> “The great successful men of the world have used their imagination.  They think ahead and create their mental picture in all its details, filling in here, adding a little there, altering this a bit and that a bit, but steadily building – steadily building.”–Robert Collier</br> “It is a paradoxical but profoundly true and important principle of life that the most likely way to reach a goal is to be aiming not at that goal itself but at some more ambitious goal beyond it.”–Arnold Toynbe</p>
